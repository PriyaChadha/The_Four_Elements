Million years ago there was a place in clouds known as heaven where a queen lived.She was known as the goddess of elements as she could control all four elements Fire,Water,Wind and Earth and she used them to create a place for humans known as land.But as they say where light is there shadow exists similiarly, there was a demon king who was defeated by the goddess and was locked in hell a place bellow land.The demon king wanted to rule over the world so he kept on capturing souls to increase his power limit.Soon he had gained enough power to capture the queen and a way to break the chains which stopped him from leaving Hell.He made a master plan to capture the queen instead of killing her so he could absorb her other powers. He had also built up a big army of skeletons.When everything was ready he destroyed the chains and teleported the whole army to Heaven.Where the army of demon king fought with the army of goddess of elements.While the whole fight the Queen knew the demon king will come to kill her in the find of the four elements powers so she turned the four elements in gems and launched them towards the land.No sooner had the gems launched the demon king teleported to the queens palace just to see elements powers to be launched away.The demon king and the element queen fought for days but in the end the demon king won and sealed the element queen in a magic resisting cage.Queen never told where the elements were launched.So, eventually the demon king gave up for the time being to find the elements but rebuilt the Heaven which looked more like hell and created many evil creatures like dragons, trolls and beasts.
